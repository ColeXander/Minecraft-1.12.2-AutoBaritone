# Minecraft-1.12.2-Baritone-Complete-AI
The 1.12.2 Baritone AI lacks a bit. I decided to fix that, with this repo, the Baritone Mining AI (ver for 1.12.2 that is) will be able to do hundreds of things more than it could before, all from a Python terminal.
Something I am planning on doing is also implementing a different AI that would handle fighting mobs/players (hopefully)

## Commands (both planned and implemented)
#### Survival ("fb start_survival")
Will tell Baritone to start off as if they just started a new survival world
The steps the Python script will tell Baritone to do are the following:
- Mine enough wood for a basic house and tools
- Build basic house completly on its own
- Save home waypoint for later
- Go away from house a bit to mine some stone and also some more wood to make stone set of tools
- Go back to house, create chest, and move wooden tools to chest
- STILL WORKING ON ALL THE STEPS IT WILL TAKE
#### Mining Mode ("fb mine _BLOCK-NAME_ _QUANITY_")
