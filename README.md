# Minecraft-1.12.2-AutoBaritone
The 1.12.2 Baritone AI lacks a bit. I decided to fix that, with this repo, the Baritone Mining AI (ver for 1.12.2 that is) will be able to do hundreds of things more than it could before from a Python terminal (reason I don't just make a mod instead of python is because im too lazy to figure out how to program mods and I'm already pretty good at Python).
Something I am planning on doing is also implementing a different AI that would handle fighting mobs/players (hopefully)

## Commands (both planned and implemented)
#### Survival ("fb start_survival")
Added in version: **Not Implemented**
Will tell Baritone to start off as if they just started a new survival world
The steps the Python script will tell Baritone to do are the following:
- Mine enough wood for a basic house and tools
- Build basic house completly on its own
- Save home waypoint for later
- Go away from house a bit to mine some stone and also some more wood to make stone set of tools
- Go back to house, create chest, and move wooden tools to chest
- STILL WORKING ON ALL THE STEPS IT WILL TAKE
#### Mining Mode ("fb mine _BLOCK-NAME_ _QUANITY_")
Added in version: **Not Implemented**
